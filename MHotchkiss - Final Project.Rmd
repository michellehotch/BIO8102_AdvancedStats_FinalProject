ROUGH NOTES NOW

-   why is it useful looking at volume?

    -   does treatment affect the volume of sugar syrup consumed?

        -   other factors: exposure period (duh) and age

    -   predictions: consistent before exposure, varied during exposure, and then don't know for after

-   what is meaningful?

    -   find control mean over entire experiment and compare to that

## Introduction

#### Background and Study System

Bees are important pollinators both for agricultural crops and natural plant communities. In recent decades, bee populations have been declining due to a combination of stressors including declines in floral resources, increases in pathogen loads, and increased pesticide use.\
\
Bees are exposed to routinely exposed to pesticides when foraging on contaminated pollen and nectar, and exposure to multiple concurrent pesticides is the norm. While pesticides can have negative effects on bee hosts, recent experiments have also shown demonstrated negative effects on bee gut microbiotas.

Social corbiculate bees (such as honey and bumble bees) have a highly inter- and intra- specifically conserved gut microbiota whose presence provides a suite of benefits to the host organism. The fact that the taxonomic structure of this community is capable of being disturbed by pesticides may present a problem if the function of this community is simultaneously disturbed, and the microbiota can no longer **play its role**.

However, few studies on pesticide-induced disturbances in bee gut microbiotas have considered an important facet of exposure to some pesticides: interval exposures. While some pesticides are systemic (i.e., certain neonicotinoids), present in plant tissue consistently, other pesticides are applied via spraying which generally occurs once every couple of weeks. In this scenario, pesticide residues are not consistently present - when accounting for floral and pollen turnover rates, pesticides are likely to present in pollen and nectar for less than one week. This shorter duration of pesticide exposure provides a pesticide-free window of time during which pesticide-disturbed bee gut microbiotas may be able to recover from pesticide exposure.

One pesticide that is applied in this way is chlorothalonil, a fungicide that is commonly used on tomato crops in greenhouses which bumble bees are purchased to pollinate. Chlorothalonil is capable of disturbing bee gut microbiotas via chronic exposure [@Kakumanu2016], but it remains unknown is it disturbs gut microbiotas under a more realistic exposure regime.\
\
For Chapter 1 of my thesis, I aim to answer the following questions: 1) Is chlorothalonil capable of disturbing bumble bee gut microbiotas under an acute exposure regime?, and 2) Are bumble bee gut microbiotas capable of recovering from pesticide-induced disturbance within the two week period between exposure events?\
\
While my data collection is finished, I do not yet have sequence data. My plan is to run a univariate model for the abundance of each microbial taxa of interest to determine how it varies with respect to time and treatment. However, I do have the amount of sugar syrup (nectar proxy) that bees consumed during my experiment. A univariate model to analyze volume of sugar syrup consumed will be similar to my univariate models to determine changes in microbial abundance, and so I will use this project as an opportunity to develop a general model structure that, for now, will explain variation in sugar syrup consumed, but which I believe will also be useful to explain variation in the abundances of core bee gut microbial taxa.

#### Hypotheses

Additives in sugar syrup can make syrup more or less enticing to bees. Additionally, older bees are **less active (?)** than younger bees and tend to consume less sugar syrup.

#### Predictions

1.  Age of bees and treatment will significantly affect volume of sugar syrup consumed.

2.  For age specifically, I believe older bees will consume less sugar syrup regardless of treatment.

## Methods

#### Bee Hosts

The bumble bee species that I used for my experiment was the Common Eastern Bumble Bee, *Bombus impatiens*. This species is the most common in eastern North America and is available to purchase as commercial colonies.

#### Experimental Set Up

I purchased five bumble bee hives from BioBest (Leamington, ON). At Week 1 and Week 3 for all colonies, and additionally at Week 7 for colonies 3 and 4, 70 workers bees were removed from each colony and divided into seven cup containers to form ten microcolonies per colony. These microcolonies were assigned to one of seven treatments: Control, Solvent Control, 1 ppb chlorothalonil (CHT), 10 ppb CHT, 100 ppb CHT, 800 ppb CHT, or Sacrificial.\
\
Microcolonies were all fed sterile sugar syrup for 6 days (Day -6 to Day 0) and allowed to acclimate to their containers. Starting on Day 0, microcolonies were then exposed to their respective treatments for five days. Control microcolonies were provided with sterile sugar *ad libitum* while Solvent Control microcolonies were provided with sterile sugar syrup spiked with DMSO (**Spell out)**. CHT exposed microcolonies were provided with sterile sugar syrup spiked with the appropriate concentration of CHT dissolved in DMSO. Sacrificial microcolonies were exposed to 800 ppb of chlorothalonil but were sacrificed on Day 5 in order to analyze the bee bodies for CHT residues. After five days of exposure, colonies were once again provided only with sterile sugar syrup for the remainder of a two-week period (Day 5-Day 14). All bees within microcolonies were frozen on Day 14. Fecal samples were taken from microcolonies on Day 0, 3, 5, 8, and 14. The volume of sugar syrup each microcolony consumed over the past 24 hours was recorded daily.

#### Statistical Methods

As my experimental design involves taking repeated measures from microcolonies, each made with bees from one of five different source colonies, I need to use a mixed model in order to account for nested random effects (specifically, microcolony nested within source colony). Whether I use a linear or generalized linear mixed model will depend on whether my residuals exhibit a Gaussian distribution or not.\
